#ANN Forward Propagation Project

Welcome to the ANN Forward Propagation Project! This repository is a simple implementation and explanation of the forward propagation process in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). 
Forward propagation is a crucial step in the functioning of neural networks, and this project aims to provide a clear understanding of how it works.
##Introduction

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a powerful machine learning technique inspired by the human brain. Forward propagation is the initial step in the operation of ANNs, where input data is passed through the network to generate predictions. This project breaks down the forward propagation process into simple steps, making it easier to comprehend.

##Network Architecture

The project employs a simple feedforward neural network architecture. You can experiment by adjusting the number of layers, neurons, and activation functions to observe how it influences the forward propagation outcomes.

Feel free to explore, learn, and build upon this project to deepen your understanding of artificial neural networks and forward propagation.
